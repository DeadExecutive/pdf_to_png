Purpose: I am using this external tool for a Unity Project I have published (G-Manage: Text-Based Adventure Creator)
This tool allowed me to convert my published book (Desora: Chronus) into PNGs to be imported similar to a Visual Novel
Disclaimer: Ghostscript is not owned by me. This Powershell script merely utilizes the tools within Ghostscript to
convert PDF Files.
